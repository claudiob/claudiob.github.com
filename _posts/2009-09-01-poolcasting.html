desc: I created a <strong>social web radio</strong> where music channels autonomously adapt in real time to satisfy a group of listeners
---

<p>
  When you listen to online radios, your musical preferences have no influence over the songs that are broadcast.
  Each radio channel plays a fixed sequence of songs, independent of who is actually listening at each time.
</p>

<p>
  Poolcasting is an intelligent system that delivers radio channels <strong>customised</strong> in real time for their current listeners, with <strong>smooth musical transitions</strong> from each song to the next. 
  An automatic process determines which music is played while listeners have the options to provide feedback, define new channels and, most importantly, contribute with their own songs to the music broadcast on the radio.

<p>
  Poolcasting is the most complex project I have invented and developed,
  combining a <em>rails</em> web interface for listeners and administrators, 
  a <em>ruby</em> intelligent process that decides which music to play in real time 
  and a <em>liquidsoap</em> streaming manager, running on a server equipped with <em>apache</em>, <em>mysql</em> and <em>icecast</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Poolcasting is also the subject of the <a href="http://www.iiia.csic.es/~claudio/papers/Baccigalupo-2009-PhdThesis.pdf">doctoral thesis</a> I will be presenting in November 2009 at the IIIA-CSIC.
</p>

<p>
  A live version of the radio is currently running in the local network of the IIIA. 
  Anyone interested can contact me to gain access to the radio or can <a href="http://github.com/claudiob/poolcasting/">download the source code</a> to run poolcasting on a private server.
